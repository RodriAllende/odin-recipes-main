        What Does Curry Taste Like? - Spice Cravings
        Curry is often described as a dish that is earthy, spicy, warming, or even sometimes sweet. It is a well-balanced, richly spiced dish with notes of deep savory flavors from turmeric, coriander, cumin, bay leaf, cinnamon, and cloves, just to name a few. Black pepper and red chilies provide spiciness and a rich hue.</p>
